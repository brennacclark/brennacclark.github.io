Hey there curious clicker! 

Thanks for checking out the source code to my portfolio project! These days, we've seen it's faster and more simple to whip up a website with no code tools such as squarespace or webflow, but there's really no substitute for full control at a low, low price of free üòÉ! I've described the major components and my thoughts behind including them in my project. Feel free to use any part of this project for academic purposes! 

üçÄ Good luck & happy developing

## Tech Stack

### [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience. It's faster, leaner, and more powerful, making it a fantastic choice for modern web development. Developed by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, Vite offers a development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and an optimized build process, out-of-the-box.

‚ú®üí≠‚ú® _I wanted to combine the rich functionality of a React app with the resource efficiency of a Vite app._


### [Mineral Components](https://mui.com/) 

Mineral Components is a powerful and flexible UI component library designed to make your development process smoother and more efficient. Built on top of the widely-used and respected Material-UI framework, it extends its capabilities and offers additional features to bring your React-based projects to the next level.

‚ú®üí≠‚ú® _I love the aesthetics and simplicity of Material Components._


### [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)

React Bootstrap is a front-end framework that merges the versatility of React and the styling ease of Bootstrap. Built as an alternative to the standard Bootstrap JavaScript, it provides React-based components that make it easier than ever to create visually appealing, responsive designs.

‚ú®üí≠‚ú® _I found the layout components such as Navbar, Container, Row, and Col to be invaluable in designing and implementing the layout._

### [React Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)

React Scroll is a lightweight library that adds smooth scrolling and scrollspy functionality to your React applications. With this library, you can easily navigate through different sections of a single-page application or scroll to specific elements within your site, enhancing user experience and engagement.

‚ú®üí≠‚ú® To give the site a modern feel, I wanted to incorporate effects that automatically scroll to the appropriate elements.

### [React Vertical Timeline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-vertical-timeline-component)

React Vertical Timeline Component is a specialized library focused on delivering easy-to-use, stylish vertical timelines for your React applications. This npm package allows developers to showcase a sequence of events, milestones, or tasks in a vertical layout, which can be particularly useful for portfolios, project timelines, or process outlines.

‚ú®üí≠‚ú® _Similar to React Scroll, I utilized the vertical timeline to depict my tech journey, aiming to make users feel as if they were joining me on this adventure._
